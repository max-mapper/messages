Instead of sending me email use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/maxogden/messages/issues) to send me messages.

That way your questions can be indexed by search engines so that other people with the same question can google it instead of emailing me in the future.

To send me a **private message** you should encrypt it using PGP and post it as an issue to the issue tracker. This is relatively easy using [keybase](https://keybase.io/)
