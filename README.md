========

Instead of sending me email use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/maxogden/messages/issues) to send me messages.

To send me a **private message** you should encrypt it using PGP and post it as an issue to the issue tracker. This is relatively easy using [keybase](https://keybase.io/). My keybase username is `maxogden`.

[Here's an example of an encrypted message thread](https://github.com/maxogden/messages/issues/9)

If you *really* want my email you can get it by looking at a raw git commit patch textfile for any commits I've pushed to GitHub. All git patches have an email in the header, and I use my real email there.
